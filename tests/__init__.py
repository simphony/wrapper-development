"""Use this module to write tests for your wrapper.

Modify the files in this module to adapt them to your own wrapper. You can
organize your test files and their contents in any way you wish and use any
testing framework.

Writing tests that cover the typical use case of your wrapper (see
`test_usage.py`) and tests that cover calls to all the wrapper API functions
you use in your wrapper (see `test_wrapper_api.py`) is very strongly
recommended, and may even be required if the wrapper is to be officially
endorsed by us.

Optionally, you can also write unit tests (see `test_unit.py`) and integration
tests (see `test_integration.py`).
