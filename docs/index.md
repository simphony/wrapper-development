on the SimPhoNy Open Simulation Platform.

MySimulationEngine is a sample molecular dynamics simulation engine. Given a 
collection of atoms, their initial positions, and their velocities, it can 
calculate their future positions, under the assumption that atoms do not exert 
any kind of force among themselves neither there are any external forces acting
on them.
