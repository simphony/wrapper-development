# Installation

This wrapper requires a working installation of MySimulationEngine. Follow 
these steps or check [this documentation to install](https://example.org) 
MySimulationEngine.

The next step is to install the wrapper itself. MyWrapperName is available on 
PyPI, so it can be installed using the `pip` package manager.

```shell
pip install package-name
```

Finally, the wrapper requires MyOntology to operate. Download the 
[ontology file](https://example.org/ontology_file.ttl) and 
[ontology package](https://example.org/ontology_package.yml), then install the
latter using the command below.

```shell
pico install ontology.yml
```

## Advanced users

If you are a developer or an advanced user, you might be interested in 
installing MyWrapperName from source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/my_organization/my_wrapper
pip install ./my_wrapper
```
