# Wrapper Development Template

The aim of this repository is to exemplify how to develop a new wrapper for 
SimPhoNy. **Before you start**, please have a look at the
[SimPhoNy documentation](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0rc4/)
(in particular the 
[wrapper development section](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0rc4/developers/wrappers.html)).

You may clone this repository and use it as a template to create your own
wrapper. It provides project configuration files, a folder structure and even a 
minimalistic implementation of a wrapper.

The version number of this project matches the number of the 
[`simphony-osp`](https://pypi.org/project/simphony-osp/4.0.0rc4/) package 
version for which it was last updated. As SimPhoNy follows the 
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention, this wrapper development
prototype should be compatible with the newest version of SimPhoNy as long as 
their major version numbers match.

**Do not forget to choose a license and change the file `LICENSE.md` before 
publishing your wrapper!**
