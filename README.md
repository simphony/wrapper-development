# Wrapper Development Template

The aim of this repository is to exemplify how to develop a new wrapper for 
SimPhoNy. **Before you start**, please have a look at the
[SimPhoNy documentation](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/)
(in particular the 
[wrapper development section](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/developers/wrappers.html)).

Clone this repository to use it as a template to create your own
wrapper. It provides project configuration files, a folder structure, an 
example of a minimalistic implementation of a wrapper, tests, and a documentation 
template. While writing the documentation, you can show it on your web browser
using [sphinx-autobuild](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild).

The version number of this project matches the number of the 
[`simphony-osp`](https://pypi.org/project/simphony-osp/4.0.0rc4/) package 
version for which it was last updated. As SimPhoNy follows the 
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention, this wrapper development
prototype should be compatible with the newest version of SimPhoNy as long as 
their major version numbers match.

**Do not forget to choose a license and change the license information in the
files `LICENSE.md`, `pyproject.toml` and `docs/conf.py` before publishing your 
wrapper!**
